# Pokemon DataViz

Taking a look into pokemon statistics through generations 1 through 7

1. Overview
- Attack/Defense stats
2. Power Creep
- Statistics by Generation

Inspiration: [Reddit September 2018 DataVisualization Contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/9cuzs3/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_september/)
Data Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/pokemon)

Future tasks:
Standard Deviation by Generation
 - high std may reveal higher number of competitive pokemon
Power Creep Filtering
 - remove non-fully evolved forms to compare final pokemon statistics
Smogon Comparison
 - get top statted pokemon to check for degree of correlation to competitive single-battle ([Smogon](www.smogon.com))
